FuelFlex - Smart Fuel Management
FuelFlex is a convenient and user-friendly application designed to streamline your fuel purchase and management experience. With FuelFlex, you have access to a virtual card that allows you to purchase fuel up to a limit of R3000 per month. If you exceed this limit, the card will temporarily be disabled until the next billing cycle.

Key Features
Monthly Fuel Limit: Purchase fuel up to a maximum of r3000 per month. If you exceed this limit, the card will no longer function until the next billing cycle.
Monthly Billing: At the end of each month, you will receive a bill for the amount of fuel consumed, plus an 11.5% interest charge. For example, if you use 500R worth of fuel, you will be charged an additional R57.50 in interest (11.5% of r500), bringing your total bill to R557.50. This includes a return charge of R17 and a profit of R40.50.
